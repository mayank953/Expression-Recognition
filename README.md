<p>In this our aim is to categorize each face based on the emotion. I have used a CNN model using Keras so as to achieve an accuracy of 60.7 %.</p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DATASET</strong></span></h2>
<p>The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centered and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression in to one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).</p>
